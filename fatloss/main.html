  <h1>Donald Jung</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/programs/undergraduate/computer-science/">Toronto Metropolitan University</a></p>
  <p>I am majoring in Computer Science</p>
  <p>Originally I studied Computer Science out of high school, but ventured to work in the fitness industry, I had a passion for fitness and nutriton, specifically the science behind weight loss, fat loss, and body composition.</p>
  <p>I worked as a personal trainer, nutrition coach, sponsored athlete (fitness supplement company), and eventually started a business selling home gym equipment to retail consumers.</p>
  <p>Unfotunately I was diagnosed with liver tumours, which led me to pivot to less physically labour intensive career and returned to study computer science. </p>
  <p>During my treatments and surgeries, I pondored about the meaning of life, specifically what should I do with my remaining time on this earth, if, I was able to live. </p>
  <p>I decided to continue studying computer science, I knew it would have a strong emphasis in mathematics and physics, which is what I was hoping to study, as I have a large interest in technology, astrophysics and quantum physics, being so close to death, I wanted to learn as much about this world as possible, how everything works from atoms and particles, energy, chemical reactions and electronics. I am hoping to combine mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology to work on or develop a service or product that will make a positive impact on the world, or society.</p>
