Vicious Circle
- Governement deficit, supply shifts left, increases supply of loanable funds
Increases the interest rate, thus slows economic growth
Slower growth > less taxes > higher spending on income > results in even higher deficit

Virtous Circle
- Government surplus > more taxes > less spending > results in faster economic growth
Decreases the interest rate, results in faster economic growth
Higher growth > more taxes > lower spending on income > results in higher budget surplus


Government Net Debt
The difference between the value of government financial liabilities and financial assets

Supply of loanable funds
As interest rates rise, we earn more on our savings so we have incentive to save.

Demand for loanable funds
If interest rates are lower, the demand for borrowing and invest goes higher
Ex. Mortgages, buying capital goods, capex, thus growth will be higher if interest rates
are lower

> Savings affect supply
> Investments affect demand

Equilibrium of interest rates
If interst rates are below equilibrium, there is an excess of demand, or shortage of loanble
funds.
If the interest rate is above equilibrium, there is an excess supply or surplus of loanable
funds
