"""Money market:
More supply > demand drops > interest rates drop > demand for loans increases > more growth
Less supply > demand rises > interest rates increase > demand for loans increase > less growth"""

"""
Fiscal Policy:
Public spending increase > increase private spending (loan), increase interest rates
Causes a decrease in interest-sensitive private spending
Increase inflation, increases demand and supply

If expansionary fiscal policy shifts aggregate supply higher, it can negate the inflationary
effects.

Interest Rates:
Increase in interest rates attracts foreign capital inflows, exchange rate appreciates
and reduces net exports. This negates GDP growth through net exports declining.

Taxes:
Higher taxes > less incentive to work > unemployement rises > lower GDP
Lower taxes > higher incentive to work > labour increases > increases GDP"""
