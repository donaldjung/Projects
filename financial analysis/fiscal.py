Fiscal policy:
Goals:
Remove output gaps, attain full employement

Tools:
Governemnt spending and taxes
Budjet balance

Political considerations:
Electrion time, politicians favour strong economy, large tax cuts or increased
government spending on education and health care

Political parties may hijack fiscal policy, cause economic fluctuations

Expansionary:
higher interest rates due to more spending/less taxes
reduction in interest sensitive private spending

Doesn't work well if trading partners experience contraction in economies as imports increase
as prices overseas will be cheaper

Increase in interest rate attracts foreign capital inflows, exhcange rate appreciates
Since the dollar increases, net exports will decrease as they are more expensive
